# nqueens
Having recently read Kent Beck's "Test-Driven Development By Example", I wanted
to try the process out, and the "n queens" problem seemed as good a project as
any.  Learning to unit test in Python was an added bonus.

The focus was on having well-structured and well-tested code, rather than
performance.

To solve a board of size n, run:

```
./solve.py n
```

To run the tests, run:

```
python3 -m unittest
```
